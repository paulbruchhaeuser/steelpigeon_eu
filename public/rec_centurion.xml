  <paragraph>
    Once forgotten and headed for the bins, this 90s mountain bike has been given a second 
    life—rescued from obscurity and rebuilt with intention, patience, and a lot of love.

    The frame carries the unmistakable spirit of the era: honest steel tubes, purposeful 
    geometry, and a time when mountain bikes were built to survive anything. Scratches and 
    scars remain as quiet reminders of past rides, but beneath them is a structure that 
    deserved far more than abandonment. What was once considered outdated has proven timeless.
