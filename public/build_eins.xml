  <paragraph>
This custom gravel steel frame was designed with one clear purpose: comfort without 
compromise, whether the ride lasts an afternoon or stretches into weeks of travel.

Built from carefully selected steel tubing, the frame balances resilience and ride feel 
in a way few materials can. Steel’s natural compliance smooths rough gravel, broken pavement, 
and endless washboard roads, reducing fatigue while maintaining a lively, responsive character. 
Every tube is chosen and shaped to suit the rider’s proportions, riding style, and intended
terrain—no generic geometry, no unnecessary stiffness.

The geometry prioritizes long-distance comfort and stability. 
A slightly taller stack and relaxed reach encourage an upright, 
sustainable position for day-long rides. The wheelbase is tuned for 
confident handling when loaded, offering stability with panniers or 
bikepacking bags while remaining agile on loose gravel and winding backroads. 
Generous tire clearance allows for wide tires, adding grip and vibration 
damping on unpredictable surfaces.
